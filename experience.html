<h4>⭐SUMMARY OF MY EXPERIENCES JOURNEY⭐</h4>

    <p style="background-image: url(image/lightpink.jpg);"> <img src="image/intern.jpg" alt="Image of intern at archive" style="height: 100px; width: 100px; float: left; font-family: Cambria;">
        I had the opportunity to begin my internship at the <strong>Office of Library and Knowledge Management,</strong> Universiti Malaysia Kelantan Bachok, where I gained valuable exposure to library operations and knowledge management practices. I also had the opportunity to complete my internship in the <abbr title="Universiti Malaysia Kelantan">UMK</abbr> archive section, where I was exposed to a professional working environment and gained practical experience in handling, organizing, and preserving archival materials. Throughout this internship, I learned the importance of proper record management, systematic documentation, and accuracy in maintaining archival records. This experience enhanced my understanding of archival processes and helped me develop essential skills such as responsibility, attention to detail, and teamwork

        I had the opportunity to manage a program called <strong>INFOFEST</strong> for the subject <abbr title="Outreach Program of Information Agencies">IMD317</abbr> where I coordinated schedules and activities to ensure the event ran smoothly. I also served as part of the Biro Persegaran, handling catering and food arrangements for VIP guests, including menu planning, supplier coordination, and maintaining high standards of quality. These experiences helped me develop skills in teamwork, time management, and event organization.
